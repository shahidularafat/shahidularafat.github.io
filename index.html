                <p>HI! This is K. M. Shahidul Arafat. A front end web developer from Bangladesh. I am an EEE(Electrical & Electronic Engineering) graduate. Previously I have worked as Contact Center Superior at SuperTel for 3 months and worked as a Customer Manager at Grameenphone Limited for more than 3 years in Bangladesh.  After going through some official job experience, I decided to work as a freelancer and here I am!</p>

                <p>I am a hard working, straight forward and flexible person. I always try to understand the situation and the nature of work thoroughly before taking it or bidding for it so that the client can relay on me. Being a full-time freelancer, I always give full effort for my work to get it done perfectly within the time limit.</p>
